<title>Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais: Letter from Gargantua to his son Pantagruel</title>
</head>


<body BGCOLOR="FFFFFF"> <h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais (1494-1553):
Letter from Gargantua to his son Pantagruel</h1> <hr SIZE=4> <cite>So
famous is the ... humor of </cite>Gargantua and
Pantagruel<cite> that its author's name has given rise to an
adjective--&quot;Rabelaisian&quot;--to describe just such
humor. Rabelais was a monk and a physician, but in his writings he
celebrated his real loves: scholarship and drinking, with the latter
often serving as a symbol of the former. As a beneficiary of the age
of the printing press, he was intoxicated by the sudden availability
of all manner of books. As much as any of the Renaissance Humanists,
it is Rabelais who articulates their view that a new age has
dawned. If his portrait of the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and
superstition is grossly exaggerated (and it is), it nevertheless helps
to convey the excitement of the Humanists during the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. This passage, a letter from father to son
advising him on his education, is written in the elaborate, balanced
style of formal prose in the period, quite unlike the tumbling, bawdy
narrative that surrounds it. Read aloud, with appropriate pauses at
the punctuation marks, it conveys a grand rhythmic majesty.</cite><br>

not <cite> approve? </cite>

But even though my late father
Grandgousier, of blessed memory, strove with all his ability that I
should profit from and learn political knowledge, and even though my
labors and studies matched or even surpassed his desires,
nevertheless, as you can well understand, the times were not fit or
favorable for learning as is the present; and I did not have the
abundance of such instructors as you have had. The times were still <a
HREF="#dark">dark</a> (1), and reflected the misery and calamity of
caused by the <a HREF="#goths">Goths</a> (2) who had destroyed all
good scholarship. But, through divine grace, during my life light and
dignity have been restored to learning; and we witness in them so much
improvement that now I would have trouble being accepted into a
children's beginning class, I who in my maturity was reputed (and not
wrongly) the most learned man of the time. I do not say this out of
vain boasting--even though I could properly do so in writing to you as
you may understand by the authority of <a
HREF="http://www.dla.utexas.edu/depts/classics/documents/Cic.html">Marcus
Tullius Cicero</a> in his book <cite>Old Age,</cite> and the teachings

of <a HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Classics/Plutarch/camillus.sum.html">Plutarch</a>
in his book titled <cite>How to Praise Oneself Honorably</cite> <a
HREF="#praise">(3)</a>--but to inspire in you the desire to strive for
the highest achievements.</strong>

Now all the disciplines have
been restored, languages revived: Greek, without which it is shameful
for a person to call himself learned: Hebrew, <a
HREF="#chaldean">Chaldean</a> (4), and Latin. Elegant and correct
printed editions are available, the result of a divinely-inspired
invention of my time, as are in contrast guns--the product of
diabolical suggestion. The world is full of learned men, fine
teachers, ample libraries; and it is my opinion that neither in the <a
HREF="#plato">time of Plato</a> (5), nor <a HREF="#cicero">of
Cicero</a> (6), nor <a HREF="#papinian">of Papinian</a> (7) were there
such opportunities for study as we see today; and no one should now go
out in public who has not been well polished in <a
HREF="#minerva">Minerva's workshop</a> (8). I see the robbers,
hangmen, freebooters and grooms of today more learned than the
theologians and preachers of my day. What can I say? Even <a
HREF="#women">women and girls</a> (9) aspire to the honor and
celestial manna of good learning. Things have changed so much that at
my advanced age I have had to learn Greek, which I had not rejected
like Cato, but which I had not had the leisure to learn in my youth;
and I delight in reading the <cite>Morals</cite> of Plutarch, the
beautiful <cite>Dialogues</cite> of <a
HREF="http://www-und.ida.liu.se/~y92bjoch/filosofer/platon.html">Plato</a>,
the <cite>Monuments</cite> of Pausanias, and the

<cite>Antiquities</cite> of Athenaeus as I await the hour at which it
may please God, my Creator, to summon and order me to leave this
world.<p> <cite>Translated by Paul Brians</cite><br> <hr SIZE=4>

Notes

<p> <a NAME="dark">(1)</a> The Humanists were fond of referring
to the Middle Ages as dark, but this must not be confused with later
definitions of the Dark Ages which ended centuries before the
Renaissance.<p> <a NAME="goths">(2)</a> The Goths, headed by Alaric,
sacked Rome in 410. This invasion is often considered to have marked
the end of the classical world and the beginning of the Dark Ages
(although many historians reject this latter term). The Humanists used
the term broadly to mean barbaric, and considered the artistic styles
which sprung up in their wake barbaric as well, calling the great
cathedrals of the High Middle Ages Gothic as an insult.<p> <a
NAME="praise">(3)</a> Like the other Humanists, Rabelais delights in
making references to ancient Latin works.<p> <a
NAME="chaldean">(4)</a> The language of the Biblical Babylonians,
famed for their astronomical and astrological studies.<p> <a
NAME="plato">(5)</a> 5th Century BCE, Greece. <p> <a
NAME="cicero">(6)</a> 1st Century BCE, Rome. <p> <a
NAME="papinian">(7)</a> 3rd Century CE, Rome. Papinian was a great
authority on Roman law. <p> <a NAME="minerva">(8)</a> Minerva (Greek
Athena) was the goddess of wisdom, so her workshop is scholarship. <p>
<a NAME="women">(9)</a> Rabelais was a great friend and admirer of the
queen and writer, Marguerite de Navarre, to whom he dedicated one of
his books.<p> <hr SIZE=4> <p> <table> <tr> <td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
